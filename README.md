# Summary
Sandbox of software tools for parsing engine log files generated by a [Great Lakes EIS-4000 Engine Information System (EIS)|https://grtavionics.com/product/eis-4000/].

Currently working on getting a single jupyter notebook working for log analysis.

## Tried So Far
* Use protobufs to parse raw logs (see log format in "Model 4000:600 Serial Data List") - this turned out to be pretty awkward and python can easily handle the task in one line with struct. The format argument to struct is a bit of a hard-coded magic number, so maybe there's room to improve this.
* Parse logs and post to InfluxDB, to allow review with Grafana - got it working, but abandoned it. InfluxDB is really not suitable for this task for several reasons:
** 5MB/5min limits on free plan mean I can't upload a full log files at will, much less a group of them. Log files may be tens of MB each, and are packed as densely as possible as binary logs; the size of the parsed data structure I'm attempting to post is likely more than 10x the size of the packed log file.
** Logs are not timestamped on engine information system, nor on the Openlog that records the datastream from the EIS. Therefore, points get grouped by processing time. This doesn't really break anything but makes the X-axis rather clumsy and misleading. A plain sequence number might be better. 
* Parse logs and process results in [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/install) - appears to be much more appropriate to my use case. 

# Note
* Working on a laptop where I have to tolerate a dev environment I didn't build, and jupyter installed from pip won't load a kernel, so I've had to install anaconda to get jupyter working. 

# Next Steps
1. Determine if plots can be interactive (zoom)
1. Collect key traces and share with groups and Jeremy for theories
1. Clean up little todos
1. Decide whether working with the loaded db makes more sense as dict(s) or dataframe(s)
1. Tag flights by tach hours at start and end
1. Add selection of flights and channels to plot
1. Evaluate uploading to savvy mx
1. Learn if protobufs offer a better way to scan for the header and struct unpack (probably not)
